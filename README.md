## React App Boilerplate ##

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) is well-curated bootstrapper for React.<br>
Since it's being developed, there are some features such as Sass or LESS that are currently not supported.<br>
This project was initially auto-scaffolded using 'Create React App', then some features are manually added.<br>
