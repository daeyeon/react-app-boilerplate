# React App Boilerplate #

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) is well-curated bootstrapper for React.<br>
Since it's being developed, there are some features such as Sass or LESS that are currently not supported.<br>
This project was initially auto-scaffolded using 'Create React App', then some features are manually added.<br>

## Features ##
- [SASS](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-css-preprocessor-sass-less-etc)
- [Hot Module Replacement](https://medium.com/@sheepsteak/adding-hot-module-reloading-to-create-react-app-e053fadf569d)

## Changes ##
- [Serving the Same Build from Different Paths](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#building-for-relative-paths)
